# Sqlite Ext

This is _extended_ sqlite build with icu4c and some other features. This makes sqlite_ext is better than regular homebrew's sqlite.

For more information check compile options in [sqlite_ext.rb](https://github.com/mecurc/homebrew-sqlite-ext/blob/main/sqlite_ext.rb)

## Roadmap

- write meson build variant
- create alpine package
- write better docs (probably never)
- write tests (probably never too)
- write a good makefile for all builds
